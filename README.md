# Room Game Project

//This repository contains my final project for my CS162 course at Oregon State University. The objective was to design a game
of sorts. In my game, there are a variety of rooms you, as a player, must go through in order to win the game. Each room has
its own objective (or no objective) and there are a series of steps needed to win the game. There are also conditions to lose
the game if uncompleted (or if too many turns have been made). The user has a limited number of terms and must complete a 
sequence of events in order to win!
